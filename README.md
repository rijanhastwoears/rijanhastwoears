## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

There is a pleasure in the pathless scripts,  
Where logic flows through functions, briefly writ,  
There is serenity in parsing bits,  
Where data streams do gracefully emit.

There is a rapture in the lonely shell,  
Where keystrokes dance like raindrops in the night,  
Each command a story it could tell,  
Of problems solved and code that runs just right.

There dwells vim, where none intrudes, save those  
Who court the terminal with practiced hand,  
Through deep recursions where the program flows,  
Like ancient spells few users understand.

By the deep stacks, and methods in their call:  
I love not GUI the less, but CLI more,  
For from these dark screens, bright solutions fall,  
Like stars that guide ships sailing far from shore.

From this ascii art that greets my sight,  
To man pages that light the coder's way,  
Here in this realm of pure black and white,  
I find the peace that colors can't convey.
